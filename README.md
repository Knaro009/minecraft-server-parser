# minecraft-server-parser
could be made way better

to scan for servers first set up masscan and scan the internet for port 25565
once you have some ips and the xml file go to the parser and plug in what you have, dont forget to put a discord webhook url
run and it will go though the file and check if it is a minecraft server

requires
masscan
requests
xmltodict
json
mcstatus 

i dont know how to really open sockets and stuff so i used mcstatus
kinda glitchy idk how fix
